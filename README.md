# WordGameCheater

A console application written in C#, to find all English words within a given string ~~of up to 8 letters.~~

### Installation

Navigate to RecursiveAnagramFinder\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\

Run RecursiveAnagramFinder.exe

**THIS PROGRAM IS WORK IN PROGRESS. LONGER STRINGS TAKE EXPONENTIALLY LONGER TO RETURN RESULTS.**

I've marked this as an issue and I have plans to increase the speed of the program in the near future.

### ChangeLog:

14 / 9 / 2020

- Code rewritten to use recursion, in order to dynamically react to input strings of different lengths without hardcoded limitations.

22 / 8 / 2020

- Initial Commit.
